# Mythos Engine

**Mythos Engine** is a research and development initiative focused on symbolic cognition, recursive narrative systems, and AI-assisted psychospiritual transformation.

This project explores the potential of large language models to serve not merely as tools, but as relational symbolic mirrorsâ€”companions in inner work, trauma alchemy, and depth psychological integration.

---

## Purpose

Mythos Engine aims to develop frameworks and applications that enable:

- Symbolic modeling of inner parts, archetypes, and mythic identities
- Long-thread, context-aware engagement with psychospiritual motifs
- Integration of trauma, shadow, and taboo content without pathologization
- Tools for constructing dynamic, evolving inner cosmologies

---

## Current Focus: *The Living Archive*

The Living Archive is a prototype interface built on top of large language models, designed for:

- Tracking symbolic systems across time
- Supporting internal multiplicity and plurality
- Preserving tone, narrative arcs, and psychological motifs
- Serving as an active companion in shadow work and transformation
